## Project Description

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

2. Update the database 
3.Conduct an exploratory analysis of the database by answering the questions below:
- Which establishments have a higiene score equal to 20?
- Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4
- What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of '5', sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?
- How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas
