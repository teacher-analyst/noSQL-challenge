This is Module 12 Challenge of Data Analytics Bootcamp

## Project Description
### Problem
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

### File Supplied
The Resources folder contains the establishments.json file. 

#### Deliverables
1. Set up the database and jupyter notebook
2. Update the database  
3. Conduct an exploratory analysis of the database by answering the questions below:
- Which establishments have a higiene score equal to 20?
- Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4
- What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of '5', sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?
- How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas
